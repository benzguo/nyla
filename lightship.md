Last night, he said, there were lights overhead. Small lights, red and blue, drifting across the sky. A sign from the Lightship, he said to her, gray-haired woman in the Dunkin Donuts. She nodded knowingly. We've been waiting for a sign. Ron Armitron levitated at the convention on Thursday. They filmed it. No strings! A lady went up there and waved her hand under his feet, over his head. Nothing! Not even a breeze. A bunch of people fainted. It was hot in there. She nodded again. She hasn't said a word.

I've been listening since I sat down, pretending to look at my phone, my coffee getting cold. Lighters are notoriously difficult to interrogate. They won't speak to you unless you let them scan your code. It's always tattooed on the left shoulder. People have tried fake tattoos, copied from furtive photos, but the Lightship is a sophisticated cult. Everyone gets a unique code. They all carry around the same modified barcode scanners, black with a yellow trigger, and a little light that goes green or red. Red means back away silently, scanner raised like a weapon, avoiding eye contact. This happens every time. They've obviously been trained. The scanners probably double as stun guns. 

No one outside the Lightship knows what the Lightship is. It could be a new kind of drug, a programmable hallucinogen. It could be a new kind of yoga, combined with a virtual reality so consuming that the yoga becomes a collective hallucination. Maybe Ron Armitron actually levitates. I sip my lukewarm coffee.

Ok, I'm going to give you my testimony, the man continues. I was in the grocery store, and as soon as I walked in the song that was playing was Hotel California – you know, "you can check in but you can never check out”. The gray haired woman just nods. Yeah, well the lady standing next to me was on her phone. I turned. 333 was on her phone. So I emailed my friend Fred, he does time operations on numbers. Fred, I say, I have a 333 here in this grocery store, it's a Key Food, and I'm standing in checkout line number 5. Well I've known Fred for years, and I thought I knew him pretty well, but everything changed that day. He's always given me advice about numbers, but I had no idea he was involved in the Lightship. After that email, all of a sudden he starts talking about this Lightship thing, like it's somehow related to the 333 I saw in the grocery store, and the rest is history. I can't do time operations like Fred yet, but I can still be a friend from new people like you. Here, you can email Fred too, let me give you his email. Just say you got it from me, Raemond from New York. Raemond with an e.
