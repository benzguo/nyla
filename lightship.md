    Last night, he said, there were lights overhead. Small lights, red and blue, drifting across the sky. A sign from the Lightship, he said to her, gray-haired woman in the Dunkin Donuts. She nodded knowingly. We've been waiting for a sign. Ron Armitron levitated at the convention on Thursday. They filmed it. No strings! A lady went up there and waved her hand underneath his legs, over his head. Nothing! Not even a breeze. A bunch of people fainted. It was hot in there. She nodded again. She hasn't said a word. I've been listening since I sat down, pretending to look at my phone, my coffee getting cold. Lighters are notoriously difficult to interrogate. They won't even speak to you unless they can scan your code, always tattooed on the left shoulder. 
    
    No one outside the Lightship knows what the Lightship is. It could be a new kind of drug, a programmable hallucinogen. It could be yoga, combined with a virtual reality so consuming that the yoga becomes a collective hallucination. Maybe Ron Armitron actually levitates.
