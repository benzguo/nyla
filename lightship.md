    Last night, he said, there were lights overhead. Small lights, red and blue, drifting across the sky. A sign from the Lightship, he said to her, gray-haired woman in the Dunkin Donuts. She nodded knowingly. We've been waiting for a sign. Ron Armitron levitated at the convention on Thursday. They filmed it. No strings! A lady went up there and waved her hand under his feet, over his head. Nothing! Not even a breeze. A bunch of people fainted. It was hot in there. She nodded again. She hasn't said a word. I've been listening since I sat down, pretending to look at my phone, my coffee getting cold. Lighters are notoriously difficult to interrogate. They won't speak to you unless you let them scan your code. It's always tattooed on the left shoulder. I've tried fake tattoos. They all carry around the same modified barcode scanners, black with a yellow trigger, and a little light that goes green or red. Red means back away silently, scanner raised like a weapon, avoiding eye contact. This happens every time. They've obviously been trained. The scanners probably double as stun guns. No one outside the Lightship knows what the Lightship is. It could be a new kind of drug, a programmable hallucinogen. It could be a new kind of yoga, combined with a virtual reality so consuming that the yoga becomes a collective hallucination. Maybe Ron Armitron actually levitates.
