Last night, he said, there were lights in the sky. Small lights, red and blue, just drifting across the sky. A sign from the Lightship, he said to her, gray-haired woman in the Dunkin Donuts. She nodded knowingly. We've been waiting for a sign. Ron Armitron levitated at the convention on Thursday. They filmed it. No strings! A lady went up there and waved her hand under his feet, over his head. Nothing! Not even a breeze. A bunch of people fainted. It was hot in there. She nodded again. She hasn't said a word.

I've been listening since I sat down, pretending to look at my phone, my coffee getting cold. Lightbeings are notoriously difficult to interrogate. They won't speak to you unless you let them scan your code. It’s always tattooed on the left shoulder – everyone gets a unique code. They all carry around the same modified barcode scanners, black with a yellow trigger, and a little diode that goes green or red. Red means back away silently. 

They scan everything, not just people. Everything must first be scanned, every universal product code verified by the green light. There aren't many barcodes at Dunkin Donuts. The man has a bottle of orange juice.

She left me. She left me for the Lightship. She left me with a note on a postcard, a portrait of Ron Armitron, probably watercolor. Rays emanating from a majestic face, all three eyes closed. No return address.

I'm sorry. I have to try this. You probably think I'm crazy, but it feels so real.

A film of oil spirals on the surface of my coffee. 

I know this is terrible. This is devastating for me, too. I'm abandoning my entire life – our life. I love you, but I've fallen in love with something else. It's a completely different kind of love. I hope you'll understand. I need to try this. I'm sorry.

I can see an edge of the gray haired woman's tattoo under the sleeve of her t-shirt. It looks new.

Ok, I'm going to give you my testimony, the man continues. I was in the grocery store, and as soon as I walked in the song that was playing was Hotel California – you know, you can check in but you can never check out. The gray haired woman just nods. Yeah, well the lady standing next to me was on her phone. I turned. 333 was on her phone. So I emailed Crystal, she does time operations on numbers. Crystal, I said, I have a 333 here in this grocery store, it's a Key Food, and I'm standing in checkout line number 5. I didn't know Crystal was involved in the Lightship or anything like that. She was just a lady on the internet who gave me advice about numbers sometimes, you know? She's usually pretty quick when I write her an email, but this time it was instant, like she was waiting for me or something. I didn't even have time to put my phone down and pick it up again. And in her email, it was just a link, a really long link, with a bunch of random letters and numbers at the end. I went to that link, and you could say I never really came back. Eventually I got back to that Key Food and I was still in line looking at my phone, but I was so disordered I just dropped my basket and walked out of there. It took me all day just to figure out where I was. I think I must have gotten off at the wrong stop or something, that's what I keep telling Crystal, because nothing's looked the same to me ever since I got back. That link was a special time operation, that's what Crystal told me.

I know this story. I've followed Crystal's links. 

[ some surreal shit happens ]

And that's pretty much it, that's my testimony. It's all on the website, you know, if you log in. Everyone's story is up there. Here, you can email Crystal too. Let me give you her email. Just say you got it from me, Raemond from New York. Yeah, Raemond with an e.

There must be more to the Lightship than these weird rituals, the scanners and tattoos, a leader who levitates. Maybe it's a new kind of drug, a programmable hallucinogen. Maybe it's some kind of yoga, combined with a virtual reality so consuming that the yoga becomes a collective hallucination.
